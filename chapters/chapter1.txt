Introduction to Web Development

Web development is the process of creating websites and web applications that run on the internet or intranet. It involves two main aspects: frontend development and backend development.

Frontend Development:
Frontend development focuses on the user interface and user experience. It involves creating the visual elements that users see and interact with in their web browsers. Key technologies include:
- HTML (HyperText Markup Language): The structure and content of web pages
- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): The styling and layout of web pages
- JavaScript: The programming language that adds interactivity to web pages
- React, Vue, Angular: Popular JavaScript frameworks for building dynamic user interfaces

Backend Development:
Backend development handles the server-side logic, databases, and application functionality that users don't see. It includes:
- Server-side programming languages like Python, Java, PHP, Node.js
- Databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB for storing data
- APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) for communication between frontend and backend
- Web servers like Apache, Nginx for hosting applications

Full-Stack Development:
Full-stack developers work on both frontend and backend aspects of web applications. They have knowledge of the complete technology stack required to build a web application from start to finish.
