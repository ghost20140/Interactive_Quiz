Database Management Systems

A Database Management System (DBMS) is software that manages databases and provides an interface for users and applications to interact with data. It ensures data integrity, security, and efficient data storage and retrieval.

Types of DBMS:
1. Relational DBMS (RDBMS): Organizes data into tables with relationships
2. NoSQL DBMS: Handles unstructured and semi-structured data
3. Object-Oriented DBMS: Stores data as objects
4. Hierarchical DBMS: Organizes data in a tree-like structure
5. Network DBMS: Uses a network model for data relationships

Key Features of DBMS:
- Data Definition Language (DDL): Creating and modifying database structure
- Data Manipulation Language (DML): Inserting, updating, and deleting data
- Data Query Language (DQL): Retrieving data from databases
- Data Control Language (DCL): Managing access permissions and security
- Transaction Management: Ensuring data consistency and reliability

Popular DBMS Examples:
- MySQL: Open-source relational database
- PostgreSQL: Advanced open-source relational database
- MongoDB: Document-based NoSQL database
- Oracle: Enterprise-level relational database
- SQL Server: Microsoft's relational database system
